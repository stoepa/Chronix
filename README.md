# Chronix

**Chronix** is a modern .NET library that brings **DDD-style aggregates**, the **Repository pattern**, and **Projections** to [EventStoreDB](https://eventstore.com/). It offers a clean and extensible way to build event-sourced systems with a focus on maintainability and developer experience.

- âœ… Clean **Repository pattern** over EventStoreDB
- âœ… Easily define **aggregates**, **entities** and **value objects** using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles
